I started with watching the week 1 tutorials, resources and related videos. 

It was a great leaning experience for me. At first I created an account on github. For a basic website, I wrote code in VScode. 
Reading the resources took me 3 hours and further the videos for further insights took me 4 more hours. When I was confident enough i started investing time on how to publish that website on a local server to make it live. 
The platform i used to publish my website is tiinyhost.com. it offered an easy way to make my website live.

In this way I was able to complete prac1 considering all the specifications as well as keeping the learning up to the mark which will continue to my future weekly practicals.
